This controller follows a state machine format. The controller has 5 different states which include: Gathering,
Running, Chasing, Powerpill and Lure. Before each even is selected a series of test are checked to see if 
Mrs. PacMan should change state. If the closest ghost is further than the distance tolerance than she enters the
Gathering state where she looks for the closest pill. If she gets to close to a powerpill in the Gathering state and
the ghosts are still futher than the distance tolerance than she enteres the Lure state. Within the Lure state she
purposly "waits" to eat the powerpill untill the ghosts are at a closer distance in order to maximize ghost eating
score. If the closest ghost is closer than the distance tolerance than Mrs. Pacman first checks to see if she is
within 10 steps of a powerpill. If so, then she enters the Powerpill state where she heads towards the closest powerpill.
If any ghosts are edible within the whole map, then Mrs. PacMan enters the Chasing state where she finds and heads
towards the closet ghost in order to eat him. Within this state she also checks to see if the closest and second
closest ghost are still edible (In case they were eaten and respawned). If either ghost are no closer edible and
closer than the distance tolerance then she enters the Running state. She can also enter the running state if the
ghosts are closer than the distance tolerance, approaching and there is no powerpill within 10 steps. Within the
running state Mrs. PacMan attempts to head in the opposite direction of the closest ghost (if a valid direction).
If not, than she tries to find the closest proportions of junctions closer than the nearest ghosts and heads in
 that direction.
